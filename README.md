# p4srv6 ... proto-typing SRv6 functions with P4 lang.

The objective of this project is to implement SRv6 functions still under discussion in P4 to make running code available for testing and demo.  Since there is no Open Source P4 switch implementation supporting SRv6, this should include basic switch features required to test SRv6.

List of SRv6 functions of interest and status:
* [draft-filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming-04](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming/)
	* T.Insert (done)
	* T.Encap (done)
* [draft-ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dmm-srv6-mobile-uplane/)
	* End.MAP (planned)
	* End.M.GTP6.D (planned)
	* End.M.GTP6.E (planned)
	* End.M.GTP4.E (planned)
	* T.M.Tmap (planned)
	* End.Limit (not planned)
